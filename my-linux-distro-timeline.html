  <h1>My Linux Timeline</h1>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <b> Kali Linux</b>
      <ul>
        <li>circa 2018</li>
        <li>
          Thought <strong>Kali Linux</strong> = <strong>Linux</strong> 😭
        </li>
        <li>
          Did some <strong>ricing</strong>, not knowing that's what it was called
        </li>
        <li>After "ricing," never booted it up again 💀</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>󰕈 Ubuntu</b>
      <ul>
        <li>circa 2019</li>
        <li>"Beginner's friend", they say</li>
        <li>
          Wondered why there was an <strong>Amazon</strong> icon on the quick launch bar 👀
        </li>
        <li>Stayed for about a month, then went back to <strong>Windows</strong></li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <b> Manjaro</b>
      <ul>
        <li>November 2023 - October 2024</li>
        <li>Another "beginner's friend" - I said 😎</li>
        <li>
          Installed it on a test PC, then moved its SSD to my main PC after <strong>Windows</strong> forgot how <strong>Wi-Fi</strong> works mid-presentation 💀
        </li>
        <li>Never went back to <strong>Windoze</strong>
        </li>
        <li>Surprisingly smooth ride - never really had major issues</li>
        <li>
          <strong>AUR</strong>
          was an absolute godsend
        </li>
        <li>
          Still got bandwagoned into the "Manjaro sucks" crowd anyway 😭
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <b> EndeavourOS</b>
      <ul>
        <li>October 2024 - until my main computer died ⚰️</li>
        <li><code>pacman -Sybau</code> and "Hip hip hoo-<code>yay</code>!"</li>
        <li>
          Finally started using <code>i3</code> and <code>pywal</code>, real man ricing
        </li>
        <li>
          Now left behind on my dead computer's corpse - alone, cold, still seeking startup 🥀
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <b> Debian</b>
      <ul>
        <li>After main computer's death - about 6 months of use</li>
        <li>
          Found an ancient netbook and tried <strong>Artix</strong>, <strong>Xubuntu</strong>, and <strong>Debian</strong>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Artix</strong> and <strong>Debian</strong> both worked, but I went with <strong>Debian</strong> for a new taste
        </li>
        <li>
          Stable, until the first update screwed a <strong>GRUB</strong> config. Thankfully, it's a documented issue
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Fastfetch</strong> isn't just named "fastfetch" - it's <i>fast</i>, even on <i>slow</i>
        </li>
        <li>
          Rock-solid overall - even ran smoothly on an <strong>Intel Atom N2600</strong> in 2024 💪
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
       Void Linux
      <ul>
        <li>July 2025 - present</li>
        <li>
          Got a new computer, so I entered the <strong>Void</strong> 🪐
        </li>
        <li>
          <code>runit</code> instead of <code>systemd</code> - fast, minimal and easier to use
        </li>
        <li>
          Solid, solid, solid... but some packages doesn't exist in <strong>XBPS</strong> 🥲
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ol>
