    <h1>My Linux Timeline</h1>

    <ol>
      <li>
         Kali Linux
        <ul>
          <li>circa 2018</li>
          <li>Thought Kali Linux = Linux 😭</li>
          <li>Did some ricing, not knowing that's what it was called</li>
          <li>After "ricing," never booted it up again 💀</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        󰕈 Ubuntu
        <ul>
          <li>circa 2019</li>
          <li>"Beginner's friend", they say</li>
          <li>
            Wondered why there was an Amazon icon on the quick launch bar 👀
          </li>
          <li>Stayed for about a month, then went back to Windows</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
         Manjaro
        <ul>
          <li>November 2023 - October 2024</li>
          <li>Another "beginner's friend" - this time I said it myself 😎</li>
          <li>
            Installed it on a test PC, then moved it to my main rig after
            Windows forgot how Wi-Fi works mid-presentation 💀
          </li>
          <li>Surprisingly smooth ride - never really had issues</li>
          <li>AUR was an absolute godsend</li>
          <li>
            Still got bandwagoned into the "Manjaro sucks" crowd anyway 😭
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
         EndeavourOS
        <ul>
          <li>October 2024 - until my main machine died ⚰️</li>
          <li>Nothing grand happened - just vibes</li>
          <li>
            <code>pacman -Sybau</code>
          </li>
          <li>
            Finally started using
            <code>i3</code>
            and
            <code>pywal</code>
            , real man ricing
          </li>
          <li>
            Now left behind on my dead computer's corpse - alone, cold, still
            seeking startup 🥀
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
         Debian

        <ul>
          <li>After main machine's death - about 6 months of use</li>
          <li>Found an ancient netbook and tried Artix, Xubuntu, and Debian</li>
          <li>
            Artix and Debian both worked, but I went with Debian for a new taste
          </li>
          <li>
            Stable, until the first update screwed a GRUB config. Thankfully,
            it's a documented issue
          </li>
          <li>
            Fastfetch isn't just named `fastfetch` - it's fast, even on slow.
          </li>
          <li>
            Rock-solid overall - even ran smoothly on an Intel Atom N2600 in
            2024 💪
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
         Void Linux

        <ul>
          <li>July 2025 - present</li>
          <li>Got a new computer, so I entered the Void 🪐</li>
          <li>
            <code>runit</code>
            instead of
            <code>systemd</code>
            - fast, minimal and easier to use
          </li>
          <li>
            Solid, solid, solid… but some packages doesn't exist in XBPS 🥲
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ol>
