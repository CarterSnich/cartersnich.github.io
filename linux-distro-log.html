    <h1>Joe Mar's Linux Distro Log</h1>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <b> Kali Linux</b>
        <small><i>circa 2018</i></small>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Thought <strong>Kali Linux</strong> = <strong>Linux</strong> 😭
          </li>
          <li>
            Did some <strong>ricing</strong>, not knowing that's what it was
            called
          </li>
          <li>After "ricing," never booted it up again 💀</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>󰕈 Ubuntu</b>
        <small><i>circa 2019</i></small>
        <ul>
          <li>"Beginner's friend", they say</li>
          <li>
            Wondered why there was an <strong>Amazon</strong> icon on the quick
            launch bar 👀
          </li>
          <li>
            Stayed for about a month, then went back to <strong>Windows</strong>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <b> Manjaro</b>
        <small><i>November 2023 - October 2024</i></small>
        <ul>
          <li>Another "beginner's friend" - I said 😎</li>
          <li>
            Installed it on a test PC, then moved its SSD to my main PC after
            <strong>Windows</strong> forgot how <strong>Wi-Fi</strong> works
            mid-presentation 💀
          </li>
          <li>Never went back to <strong>Windoze</strong></li>
          <li>Surprisingly smooth ride - never really had major issues</li>
          <li><strong>AUR</strong> was an absolute godsend</li>
          <li>
            Still got bandwagoned into the "Manjaro sucks" crowd anyway 😭
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <b> EndeavourOS</b>
        <small><i>October 2024 - until my main computer died ⚰️</i></small>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <code>pacman -Sybau</code> and "Hip hip hoo-<code>yay</code>!"
          </li>
          <li>
            Finally started using <code>i3</code> and <code>pywal</code>, real
            man ricing
          </li>
          <li>
            Now left behind on my dead computer's corpse - alone, cold, still
            seeking startup 🥀
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <b> Debian</b>
        <small>
          <i>After main computer's death - about 6 months of use</i>
        </small>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Found an ancient netbook and tried <strong>Artix</strong>,
            <strong>Xubuntu</strong>, and <strong>Debian</strong>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Artix</strong> and <strong>Debian</strong> both worked, but
            I went with <strong>Debian</strong> for a new taste
          </li>
          <li>
            Stable, until the first update screwed a
            <strong>GRUB</strong> config. Thankfully, it's a documented issue
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Fastfetch</strong> isn't just named "fastfetch" - it's
            <i>fast</i>, even on <i>slow</i>
          </li>
          <li>
            Rock-solid overall - even ran smoothly on an
            <strong>Intel Atom N2600</strong> in 2024 💪
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <b> Void Linux</b>
        <small><i>July 2025 - present</i></small>
        <ul>
          <li>Got a new computer, so I entered the <strong>Void</strong> 🪐</li>
          <li>
            <code>runit</code> instead of <code>systemd</code> - fast, minimal
            and easier to use
          </li>
          <li>
            Solid, solid, solid... but some packages doesn't exist in
            <strong>XBPS</strong> 🥲
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ol>
